Drivers, API and sample programs for ISE/SSE/JSE boards.

This directory contains driver and API software for Picture Elements
ISE/SSE/JSE boards. You can build/install as much of this software as
you need, so long as you do it in the proper order.

* The driver

First, install the driver. The kernel mode driver is in the directory
"sys-linux2.4". In spite of the name, this driver supports Linux 2.6
kernels. The driver module itself is stand-alone, but the driver
interface header file <ucrif.h> is necessary for building the API, so
you at least need to install that.

NOTE: The Windows driver for ISE/SSE/JSE is not distributed in source
form. If you need the Windows driver (i.e. it did not come with your
boards) get it from Picture Elements.

* The API

The "libiseio" directory contains the source for the API. The API
definition, in libiseio.h, supports Windows and Linux, and the source
is divided into the Windows version and the Linux version. See the
appropriate directory for building and installing the API on your
system.

* Utility/Sample programs.

After the driver is installed and the API build and installed, you can
build the sample and utility programs. See the instructions in the
ucrpipe/ directory and the ise-getenv/ directory.

* video_scope

The video_scope is a QT based application that demonstrates the use of
the live mode of diagjse.scof on JSE style boards. To build this, you
need the API installed, and you need QT installed on your system. See
the video_scope/ directory for details.
