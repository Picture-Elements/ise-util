LIBISEIO FOR LINUX

This directory contains the source for the libiseio library for
Linux. To build and install you will need only gcc installed and
enough shell utilities to run the configure script. If you received
this code via git, you will also need the "autoconf" package.

You also will need to install the ucrif.h header file from the linux
device driver install. You don't necesarily need to build in install
the entire device driver, as long as you install the ucrif.h header
file in the right place.

* Step 0:

If you need to generate the "configure" script, execute:

   autoconf

* Configure and Compile.

Compilation is simple, and is done in the usual "GNU" way:

   ./configure --prefix=/usr
   make

* Install

Let "make" do it for you:

   make install

This will install the libiseio.so shared object and the libiseio.h
header file. Now you are ready to develop applications that use
ISE/SSE/JSE boards.
